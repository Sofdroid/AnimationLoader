AnimationLoader
===============
Animation loader contains an easy to use GIFView class that can be used in your project to display gif files.

Be careful because this is only the initial version of the class and I don't have much lots of experience so it might kill your cute kitten or destroy your phone.

Use it at your own risk. Have fun! :)
